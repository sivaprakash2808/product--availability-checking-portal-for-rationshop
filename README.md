 TITLE: PRODUCT AVAILABILITY CHECKING PORTAL FOR RATION SHOP

Project titled “Product Availability Checking Portal for Ration Shop” is to digitalize the process followed in the ration shop. 
The ledger records are converted to digital records. Upon consumer’s purchase a bill will be generated which holds the complete 
data of the purchase made. This saves the manual time spent for this complete process of searching the consumer details in the 
ledger and making an entry to it.This reduces the work effort of the employee who stays in the ration shop and makes the buying 
process easy for the consumer. There is a separate pass code provided for every consumer upon registration. Only after keying in 
the correct pass code at the time of purchase, the purchase will be complete.This ensures security. The other benefits of this 
application are easy data analysis, finding the most demanded product for every specific area, identifying the frequently sold products.
